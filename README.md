# Bachelor Project Repository

This repository contains the code developed for my BSc project at the Department of Chemistry, University of Oslo (UiO).

- `DMRG_sweep/`: Contains code for estimating the ground state energy of hydrogen using the Matrix Product State (MPS) framework combined with a finite-difference grid.

- `QCDMRG/`: Contains the code used for running PySCF simulations.
